# Plan of Action

## Basics
- I am going to use rust because I have heard that it's pretty effecient and modern and what and because I have been wanting to work with it for a long time
- it's gonna run on zsh since that's the shell I use 
- I wanna make it because I love staring at cava. But I think it's missing some balls. 

## Scope
- cava but without cross platform-ness 
- you can throw in balls in the ava (audio visualizer) and the balls are going to bounce around the bars!!
- it should be effecient, responsive and reasonably customizable... should atleast run my rose-pine theme 

## Steps
- how is audio even processed in linux? I believe it must be a real time stream of bits 
- let me first check out how to get audio in a tangible form in Rust
- then I would have to check how that stream of bits is converted into the bars 
- then I will find a way to print those bars
- then I will add a way to click and add ball like structures
- then I would have to handle the falling and collision and bouncing physics 

and all of this has to be effecient since the magic of cava is in seeing the beats in real-time :)
